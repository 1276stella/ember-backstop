Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### First do this...
```
ember install ember-backstop
```

### Next, for Git...
Add these lines to your `<project>/gitignore`...
```
  #backstopjs
  html_report
  bitmaps_test
```

### If you use Mirage 
Add this line to `<project>/mirage/config.json`...
```
  this.passthrough('/backstop/**');
```

### If you test with `ember test`
Add this to your `<project>/testem.js`...
```
  proxies: {
    '/backstop': {
      target: 'http://localhost:3000',
      secure: false,
    },
  },
```

Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Backstop-remote service
You will need the backstop-remote service running for visual tests.

In a seperate window run...

```
ember backstop-remote
```

Leave that running while you're testing. When you don't need it anymore you can either close the window or run `ember backstop-stop` to stop the service.

### Running Ember Server
Ember-Backstop works with `ember test` and `ember serve` e.g.

```
ember test --server --filter="your_test_name_partial"
```

or

```
ember serve
```

### Adding a visual regression test is simple...
First import the backstop helper into your test...

```
import backstop from 'ember-backstop/test-support/backstop';
```

Then add an `await backstop(assert);` assertion to any UI state you want to test...

```
  test('it renders the thing', async function(assert) {
    await visit('/sales/company/11102');
    await backstop(assert);
    assert.dom('#myFancyElement').exists();
  });
```

Now, whenever you run a test, BackstopJS will take a screen shot and compare it against the last known good. 

### The first run
The first time you run backstop-helper tests BackstopJS will fail because there aren't any reference files yet. So, here's what you do...

1. run tests normally
2. When tests complete, in another window run `ember backstop-approve`

Your next test run should now pass.

### View the most recent BackstopJS test report
You can always view the last test run report by running the following in another window...

```
ember backstop-report
```


### Approving changes
Anytime you want to promote a changed test to the new reference file, run...

```
ember backstop-approve
```  

This command also takes an optional `filter` parameter e.g. 

```
ember backstop-approve --filter=testFilenameAsRegExString
```

### Advanced
The implementation of BackstopJS for this addon relies on Ember helpers to set up your application state.  So many scenario-level configuration features BackstopJS offers (e.g. click helpers, readyEvents, etc.) are not needed. The config file is thus added to your project and stays static during tests.  (for reference see this blueprint... https://github.com/garris/ember-backstop/blob/master/blueprints/ember-backstop/files/ember-backstop/backstop.js)

However, if you are familiar with BackstopJS and would like to modify configuration for any given assertion you can pass a BackstopJS scenario config object with your assert...
```
await backstop(assert, {scenario: {selectors: '.jumbo'}});
```
see this thread for more info... https://github.com/garris/ember-backstop/issues/8#issuecomment-526861527

### More Info
See [http://backstopjs.org](http://backstopjs.org) for documentation on BackstopJS -- but keep in mind -- for this implementation all DOM interactions should probably be done in your Ember test -- and not the BackstopJS config.

### Issues

#### If your screenshots are blank
Take a look at your test network calls.  Are you seeing `UnrecognizedURLError` errors?  If so, there may be an issue with a middleware addon dependency loading too early. Try ensuring any server dependencies don't block proxy requests to `/backstop/`. Post the issue [here](https://github.com/garris/ember-backstop/issues) and let us know!
